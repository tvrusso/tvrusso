- I'm one of the project maintainers for
  [Xastir](https://github.com/xastir/Xastir).

- I am a retired search and rescue incident commander, and have
  written a few projects designed to help search and rescue process
  incident information for ELT searches.  These are languishing somewhat
  since I retired and since the Proj library changed its API.

- In March of 2023 I retired as a developer in the
  [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) project, whose GitHub project is at
  [Xyce](https://github.com/Xyce).  I had been with that project for 23 years.
