- I'm a developer in the [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov/) project.
- I'm one of the project maintainers for [Xastir](https://github.com/xastir/Xastir).
- I am a retired search and rescue incident commander, and have
  written a few projects designed to help search and rescue process
  incident information for ELT searches.  These are languishing somewhat
  since I retired and since the Proj library changed its API.
